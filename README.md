# Simple Suits Add-on Reboot
## Info
This add-on was released in 2023 but I guess I'll remake it for stable versions as well and now it's Free and open-source under MIT License
Features:
- Over 100+ Outfits to wear
- This can be craftable
- Soon to be dyeable from cauldron

## License
This add-on is under MIT License but it's better also to support my work by downloading it from MCPEDL, Modbay and Curseforge and you can send some tips and donations via Paypal and Patreon

## Description

Anyway this is the rebooted version since I'm not active to my second account but this could be the better version unlike the older one before and it could up 16 colors to try and it has more suits to try

Clothes on the list:

*   Motorcycle Helmet
*   Cap
*   T-shirt
*   Jacket
*   Pants
*   Shoes
*   Biker Helmet
*   Mortarhead (or this can be called Graduation Cap)
*   Toga
*   Sando (White Tank)
