# Simple Suits Add-on Reboot
## Info
This add-on was released in 2023 but I guess I'll remake it for stable versions as well and now it's Free and open-source under MIT License
Features:
- Over 100+ Outfits to wear
- This can be craftable
- Soon to be dyeable from cauldron

## License
This add-on is under MIT License but it's better also to support my work by downloading it from MCPEDL, Modbay and Curseforge and you can send some tips and donations via Paypal and Patreon
